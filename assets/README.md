# Assets Directory

This directory should contain the following image assets for the app:

## Required Assets

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024px)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image (1284x2778px for iPhone 13 Pro Max)
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon (1024x1024px)
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon (48x48px)

## How to Generate

You can use online tools to generate these assets from a single logo:

1. Create your app logo/icon
2. Use [Expo Icon Builder](https://buildicon.netlify.app/) or similar tools
3. Place generated files in this directory

## Temporary Solution

For development, you can use placeholder images or emoji-based icons.

The app will work without these assets during development, but you'll see warnings.
